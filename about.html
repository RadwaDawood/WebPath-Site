    <P class="lan-p"><span>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language</span>, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.<br>
        Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. 
        Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.<br>

        As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" 
        a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.<br>

        Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings,
        paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.

        Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.

        <span>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets </span>.Cascading Style Sheetsare arguably one of the greatest things that happened to the web just over a decade ago. As you were writing your HTML in the previous tutorial, you might have thought that building a web page was lacking something. CSS is not only beautiful and stylish, but it is also very efficient.<br>

        Cascading Style Sheets reside on the client side, which means the user can, with the correct knowledge, see all of your CSS files. Style Sheets were invented because the internet was plum boring due to the creators being scientists who were primarily interested in using the internet as a medium for communication (At least, that’s how I’ll write the history books on it). Kudos to them on developing the internet though.<br>

        While the internet is awesome, thank goodness we have the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Some genius over there said, “Hey, let’s make styling into a file type so we can have other pages link to it.” He is my unnamed hero. This means you can create billions and zillions of HTML files using a particular naming structure on the HTML elements and 1 CSS file that can style all of them

    <h4 class="tit">JavaScript</h4>
    <P class="lan-p">
        JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

        JavaScript was first known as<span> LiveScript </span>, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name<span> LiveScript </span>. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.

        The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.</li>
             <li>Designed for creating network-centric applications.</li>

            <li>Complementary to and integrated with HTML.</li>

<div class="angular-lan">
    <h4 class="tit">AngularJS</h4>
    <P class="lan-p">
        <span>Angular is one of the more popular JavaScript frameworks</span> in use today. With the backing of a huge company (Google) and the widespread use in the corporate world, it certainly deserves consideration when you are planning your next app development. In this blog I'll take a quick look at the key features of Angular.

        Angular was created by Google and was originally released in 2010 as AngularJS—the 1.x version. The initial release for the Angular 2.x version was on September 14, 2016. While the initial release of preview alpha and beta versions existed in 2015, fall 2016 is when we started to see some real traction in the usage.

        The second major revision was initially referred to as AngularJS 2 or 2.0 but was later rebranded to just “Angular” for release 2.0 and higher. The 5.x version in beta was just published at the time this was written. If you feel something is missing, it’s version 3—because it was skipped. While Angular was on release 2.0, the Angular router was already on version 3, so in order to sync everything up, they jumped from 2.x into 4.x.

        Angular is a free, unlicensed library, so there are no perfect usage statistics—but there are several places we can look to for a good idea. Angular has over 32,000 stars on GitHub and over 1 million npm downloads per month at the time of writing. Some of this traffic might, of course, be from development machines or mirrors, but these are good quick stats to get an idea of just how popular the library is.

<div class="php-lan">
    <h4 class="tit">PHP</h4>
    <P class="lan-p">
        PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.<br>

        PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".<br>

        PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.<br>

        It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.<br>

        PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.<br>

        PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time.<br>

        PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible.<br>

        PHP Syntax is C-Like. <br>
